# Chat-App Frontend

This is the frontend repository for a modern and dynamic chat application. Built with the latest web technologies and frameworks, this repository serves as the client-side codebase for the Chat-App.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: This project is powered by Next.js, a React framework that provides server-side rendering and routing capabilities for creating fast and efficient web applications.

- **React**: The heart of the user interface, React, is used to build the components and manage the application's state.

- **Socket.io-client**: For real-time communication, we utilize Socket.io-client, enabling instant message delivery and seamless chat experiences.

- **Formik and Yup**: Formik, combined with Yup, makes form management and validation straightforward and robust.

- **Dayjs**: Dayjs is used for handling and formatting date and time data in a user-friendly manner.

- **Zustand**: For state management, we leverage Zustand, a small and fast state management library for React.

- **axios**: Axios is employed for making asynchronous HTTP requests, ensuring efficient data retrieval and interaction with the server.

- **React Icons**: This library provides a wide range of icons for a visually appealing and intuitive user interface.

- **Tailwind CSS**: The user interface is styled using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid and flexible styling of components.

- **js-cookie**: Used for managing cookies and client-side storage.

- **Sonner**: A dependency used for a specific functionality, please refer to the project documentation for details.

## Scripts
